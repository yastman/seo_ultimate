## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Deep mechanical cleaning of the paintwork to achieve a "smooth as glass" surface before polishing or coating.
**User Problems:**

-   Paint feels rough or "sandpapery" even after a thorough wash.
-   Embedded rail dust (orange dots) or tree sap that doesn't come off.
-   Paint overspray from a nearby body shop.
-   Fear of scratching the paint while trying to clean it.

**Benefits:**

-   Reveals the true condition of the clear coat.
-   Prevents contaminants from clogging polishing pads (making polishing safer and faster).
-   Allows waxes and ceramics to bond much better, increasing their durability.
-   Restores reflectivity by removing micro-obstructions on the surface.

## 2. Clay Bar vs Auto-scrub (Comparison)

-   **Traditional Clay (Глина):** Absorbs dirt into itself. Requires constant folding. If dropped, it's garbage. Better for extremely delicate/soft paints as it provides more tactile feedback.
-   **Auto-scrub (Спонжи, рукавицы):** Synthetic polymer layer that "shaves" off the contaminants. Can be rinsed if dropped. Works faster for larger areas. More durable (can do 20-50 cars).

## 3. Aggressiveness Levels

-   **Fine (Мягкая):** Safe for regular maintenance. Minimum risk of marring.
-   **Medium (Средняя):** For cars that haven't been cleaned for years. Might leave slight haze (marring) that needs light polishing afterwards.
-   **Heavy (Жёсткая):** For heavy overspray and industrial fallout. Post-polishing is mandatory.

## 4. Successful Workflow

1. **Pre-wash:** Remove all loose dirt.
2. **Chemical Decon:** Use an Iron Remover to dissolve metal particles (reduces the work for the clay).
3. **Lubrication:** Heavily spray a dedicated clay lubricant.
4. **Slide, Don't Press:** Gently glide the clay/scrub in straight lines. Listen for the "scratchy" sound — it goes away as the surface becomes clean.
5. **Knead & Fold:** (For clay only) Fold frequently to a clean side.
6. **Rinse & Dry:** Remove lubricant residue.

## 5. Common Mistakes

-   **Insufficient Lube:** Causes "clay marring" (scratches from the clay itself).
-   **Using dropped clay:** One grain of sand inside the clay will ruin the whole panel.
-   **Working on hot paint:** Lubricant dries, clay sticks and leaves streaks.
-   **Using aggressive clay on soft paint:** Thinking "harder is faster" — it just creates more work for polishing.

## 6. FAQ (Top 5)

1. **Как часто нужно чистить кузов глиной?** (Usually 1-2 times a year, or always before polishing/ceramic coating).
2. **Как понять, что пора использовать глину (тест с пакетом)?** (Put your hand in a thin plastic sandwich bag and slide over clean, wet paint. If it feels bumpy, you need clay).
3. **Можно ли использовать воду в качестве лубриканта?** (No, water doesn't provide enough surface tension/glide — you risk scratching).
4. **Удаляет ли глина воск с машины?** (Yes, mechanical cleaning will strip most existing waxes and sealants).
5. **Можно ли использовать глину для стекол?** (Yes, it's excellent for removing stubborn film and water deposits from glass).

## 7. Expert Tips

-   **Storage:** Store clay in a small airtight container with a splash of lubricant to keep it soft.
-   **Warmth:** If the clay is stiff (in winter), put it in warm water for a few minutes to make it pliable.
-   **Auto-scrub Pad:** Pro-tip: Use an auto-scrub pad on a DA machine at very low speed with plenty of lubricant for ultra-fast decontamination.
