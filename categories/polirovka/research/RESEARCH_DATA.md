## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Total restoration of the car's visual appeal and preparation of the surface for long-term protective coatings.
**User Problems:**

-   Scratched and dull paint (loss of pride in ownership).
-   Low resale value due to poor paint condition.
-   Misunderstanding the difference between "masking" defects (wax) and "removing" defects (polishing).
-   Fear of damaging the paint (especially DIYers).

**Benefits:**

-   Restores the "showroom shine".
-   Removes permanent surface contaminants and oxidation.
-   Creates a perfectly flat surface for ceramic/graphene coatings to bond.
-   Significant increase in vehicle resale value.

## 2. The Detailing Philosophy: LAM (Least Aggressive Method)

-   **The Principle:** Always start with the least aggressive pad and paste combination that gets the job done.
-   **Why?** Every polishing step removes a thin layer of clear coat. Saving as much clear coat as possible ensures the paint's longevity.

## 3. Polishing Workflow (The "Big Picture")

1. **Chemical Decontamination:** Iron and Tar removal.
2. **Mechanical Decontamination:** Clay bar or auto-scrub (removes embedded particles).
3. **Masking:** Taping off sensitive areas (rubber, unpainted plastic).
4. **Correction Stage:** Cutting out deep defects.
5. **Polishing Stage:** Removing haze and refining the finish.
6. **Finishing Stage:** Absolute gloss and hologram removal.
7. **Panel Wipe:** Removing polish oils with IPA to reveal the true state of the paint.

## 4. Equipment & Materials

-   **Machines:** Dual Action (Safe, all-purpose) vs Rotary (Fast, correction-focused).
-   **Abrasives:** Heavy Cut (fast removal), Medium/One-step, and Finish/Anti-hologram.
-   **Interfacial Tools:** Wool (max cut), Microfiber (high cut/finish balance), Foam (versatile).
-   **Control:** High CRI flashlights or sunlight-simulating detailing lamps.

## 5. Decision Support (Myths vs Reality)

-   **Myth:** "Polishing removes all scratches." -> **Reality:** If a scratch is through the clear coat (you can feel it with a nail), only painting helps.
-   **Myth:** "Machine polishing is always dangerous." -> **Reality:** Modern DA machines are very safe and hard to damage the paint with.
-   **Myth:** "Polish and Wax are the same." -> **Reality:** Polish cleans/cuts the surface; Wax protects the surface.

## 6. FAQ (Top 5)

1. **Сколько раз можно полировать машину?** (Depends on factory clear coat thickness; usually 3-5 aggressive sessions, or dozens of light finishings).
2. **Можно ли полировать машину на солнце?** (No, chemicals dry out and stick to the paint, results become uneven).
3. **Нужно ли полировать новую машину?** (Yes, a "New Car Prep" often involves light polishing to remove transport damage and oxidation).
4. **Что лучше для новичка — ручная или машинная полировка?** (Machine DA is safer and much more effective than hand polishing).
5. **Как долго держится эффект?** (Effect is permanent since defects are removed, but the paint can get new scratches if not washed properly).

## 7. Expert Recommendations

-   **System Thinking:** Use a single brand system (like ZviZZer) when starting out. Their chemists designed the pads and pastes to work perfectly together.
-   **Lighting:** You cannot polish what you cannot see. Invest in a good detailing light.
-   **Protection:** Polishing leaves the paint "naked". Always apply a wax, sealant, or ceramic coating immediately after finishing.
