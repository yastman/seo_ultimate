## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Acquisition of a tool to automate the polishing process, improve result quality, and reduce physical fatigue.
**User Problems:**

-   Fear of "burning" the clear coat.
-   Holograms left by previous (often rotary) work.
-   Inability to reach tight spots (mirrors, grilles).
-   Heavy vibrations causing hand numbness.
-   Cord getting in the way (scratching the car).

**Benefits:**

-   Dramatic time saving compared to hand polishing.
-   Uniform result across the whole panel.
-   Ability to use professional compounds and pads.
-   Versatility (can also apply waxes and sealants).

## 2. Rotary vs Dual Action (DA)

-   **Rotary (Роторная):** Single axis rotation. Very powerful, high heat. Best for cutting deep defects. High risk of burning through edges. Leaves holograms.
-   **Dual Action (Эксцентриковая/DA):** Rotates and orbits simultaneously. Safest for beginners. Low heat build-up. Hologram-free finish. Stops rotating if too much pressure is applied (safety feature).

## 3. The "Throw" Guide (Orbital Stroke)

-   **8-10mm:** Small stroke, easy to control. Great for starters or applying protection.
-   **15mm:** The professional standard. Best balance between cutting power and ability to follow body contours.
-   **21mm:** Large "swing". Maximum coverage for large flat panels. Harder to use on curved surfaces like fenders.

## 4. Cordless (Battery) vs Corded

-   **Corded:** Limitless run time, usually more power for the price, lighter (no battery weight). Good for full-day shop work.
-   **Cordless:** Ultimate freedom. No risk of cord scratching the car. Perfect for interior, mobile detailing, or quick "spot" jobs. _Liquid Elements A1000/A2000_ lead this segment.

## 5. Mini & Specialized Machines

-   **Mini DA/Rotary:** Use 1-3 inch pads. Mandatory for bumpers, mirrors, A-pillars, and interior trims.
-   **Nano/Pico (A800 Pico):** For the most intricate parts (emblems, interior door handle surrounds).

## 6. Safety & Success Tips

1. **Always start with DA:** If you are a beginner, do not buy a Rotary machine as your first tool.
2. **Speed management:** More speed is not always more cut. Most work is done at speeds 3-4 (out of 6).
3. **Flat is key:** Keep the pad perfectly flat on the surface for even heat and cut.
4. **Cord management:** Always put the cord over your shoulder to keep it away from the paint.

## 7. FAQ (Top 5)

1. **Какая машинка лучше для новичка?** (Dual Action with 15mm stroke - e.g., T4200).
2. **Что такое эксцентрик?** (Simple explanation of the orbital movement).
3. **Можно ли сжечь лак машинкой?** (With Rotary - easily. With DA - very hard, but possible on plastic edges).
4. **Зачем нужны маленькие машинки (мини)?** (For areas where a 125mm pad simply doesn't fit).
5. **Как долго живет аккумулятор?** (Usually 30-45 mins per battery, with 2 batteries usually allowing continuous work as one charges).

## 8. Expert Tips (Liquid Elements Focus)

-   **Ergonomics:** LE machines are known for low vibration levels, which is crucial for professional health (preventing carpal tunnel).
-   **Constant Speed Electronics:** Ensure the machine doesn't bog down when you apply light pressure.
-   **A1000 V4 Versatility:** It can be switched between Rotary and DA modes, making it the most versatile mini-tool on the market.
