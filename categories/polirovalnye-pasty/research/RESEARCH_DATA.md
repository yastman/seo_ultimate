## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Scientific removal of paint defects (scratches, swirl marks, oxidation) to restore mirror-like gloss and transparency of the clear coat.
**User Problems:**

-   Swirl marks (cobwebs) visible under sunlight.
-   Deep scratches that don't go to the primer but are visible.
-   Hazy or oxidized paint (loss of color depth).
-   Holograms left after improper previous polishing.
-   Water spots and bird dropping etchings.

**Benefits:**

-   Professional "as-new" finish.
-   Preparation for ceramic coatings or waxes (proper adhesion).
-   Enhanced color depth and metallic flake pop.
-   Smooth surface that repels dirt better.

## 2. Classification of Polishing Compounds

-   **Heavy Cut (Compounds):** Large abrasive particles. For removing P1200-P1500 sand marks, deep scratches, and heavy oxidation.
-   **Medium Cut (Polishes):** Balanced removal and finish. For moderate swirls and light scratches.
-   **Fine/Finish Cut:** Ultra-fine particles. For removing holograms, adding maximum gloss, and preparing for protection.
-   **Micro-Fine/Antihologram:** For the most delicate finishing steps, especially on dark colors.
-   **One-Step (AIO):** Diminishing abrasives that start as heavy cut and break down into fine polish.

## 3. Decision Tree (Selection Guide)

-   **Paint Hardness:** German cars (hard paint) need aggressive compounds (3D ACA 510); Japanese cars (soft paint) need gentler approaches to avoid marring.
-   **Machine Type:** Dual Action (DA) machines are safer and work best with modern emulsions; Rotary machines are faster but generate more heat.
-   **Defect Depth:** If you can feel the scratch with a fingernail, a paste might not remove it completely.

## 4. Professional Workflow

1. **Decontamination:** Wash, Iron removal, and Clay bar are mandatory before any polishing!
2. **Masking:** Protect rubber, plastic trim, and emblems with masking tape.
3. **Test Spot:** Always test the least aggressive combination first.
4. **Section Work:** Work in small areas (40x40 cm). Use 4-5 drops of paste.
5. **Clean the Pad:** Clean the pad after every section to prevent abrasive clumping.

## 5. Common Mistakes

-   Polishing in the sun or on a hot hood (paste dries out too fast).
-   Using too much paste (pads get saturated and stop cutting).
-   Not cleaning the polish residue between steps (hides remaining defects).
-   Crossing "dirty" and "clean" steps (using the same microfiber for heavy cut and finish).

## 6. FAQ (Top 5)

1. **Можно ли использовать пасту без машинки (вручную)?** (Hard work, low efficiency for defect removal, only for very light cleaning/gloss).
2. **Как понять, какая паста мне нужна?** (Explanation of the "Test Spot" method).
3. **Удаляет ли паста глубокие царапины до металла?** (No, only clear coat defects).
4. **Нужно ли смывать пасту после работы?** (Yes, using IPA or specialized degreasers to check results).
5. **Что такое голограммы и как их убрать?** (Result of rotary polishing, removed by fine antihologram pastes).

## 7. Expert Tips (Brand Systems)

-   **ZviZZer System:** Color-coded simplicity. Red pad + Red paste = Heavy Cut. Yellow pad + Yellow paste = Fine Cut.
-   **3D ACA 510/520:** Non-diminishing abrasives (NDA). They don't break down, allowing for a longer working time and consistent cut.
-   **Low Dust:** Modern premium pastes like ZviZZer produce almost no dust, keeping the shop clean and reducing cleanup time.
