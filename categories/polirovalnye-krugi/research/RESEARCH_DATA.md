## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Selection of the optimal "mechanical interface" for paint correction — balancing defect removal and surface safety.
**User Problems:**

-   Overheating the paint (burn-through risk).
-   Pads falling apart (delamination due to heat/vibration).
-   Finding the right size for a specific machine.
-   Choosing between hundreds of colors and materials.
-   Marring/Haze left by overly aggressive pads.

**Benefits:**

-   Faster work (higher productivity).
-   Better finish (fewer steps needed).
-   Protection of the paint from excessive heat.
-   Cost-effectiveness (long-lasting professional pads like ZviZZer Thermo).

## 2. Materials Classification

-   **Foam (Поролон):** The most versatile. Closed-cell (stiff) for cutting, Open-cell (soft) for finishing.
-   **Wool (Мех):** Natural sheepskins or hybrid mixes. Unbeatable for heavy cutting on hard clear coats. Generates less friction heat but can be messy.
-   **Microfiber (Микрофибра):** Aggressive cutting with a surprisingly good finish. Best for Dual Action machines.

## 3. Decision Tree (Hardness & Color)

_Using the ZviZZer / European System:_

-   **Blue/Red (Extreme/Heavy Cut):** Paired with heavy compounds. For deep scratches.
-   **Orange (Medium/One-Step):** The "workhorse". For moderate defects.
-   **Yellow (Fine/Finish):** For gloss enhancement and hologram removal.
-   **Green (Ultra Fine):** For applying glazes, waxes, and final jeweling.

## 4. Size & Compatibility Guide

-   **75-80mm (3 inches):** For bumpers, mirrors, pillars, and tight areas.
-   **125-130mm (5 inches):** The industry standard for DA and Rotary machines. Best balance.
-   **150-160mm (6 inches):** For large flat panels (hoods, roofs), mainly for Rotary pros.
-   **Backing Plate:** The pad must always be slightly larger than the backing plate (e.g., 140mm pad for 125mm plate) for edge protection.

## 5. Cleaning & Care

1. **In-process cleaning:** Use a pad brush or compressed air (Tornador style) after every section.
2. **End-of-day wash:** Use specialized pad cleaners. Do not use dish soap (can degrade foam).
3. **Drying:** Air dry with the Velcro side up. Never use high heat or direct sun.
4. **Retention:** If the Velcro side is peeling, the pad is dead (fire hazard/projectiles).

## 6. FAQ (Top 5)

1. **Сколько кругов нужно на одну машину?** (Pros use 3-5 pads per step per car to avoid saturation and overheating).
2. **Как часто нужно менять круг во время работы?** (Every 2-3 panels, or when it feels "heavy" and hot).
3. **Почему круг рвется по центру?** (Overheating on DA machines — "Thermo" pads fix this with a center hole).
4. **Можно ли стирать круги в стиральной машинке?** (Not recommended for high-quality detailing pads; hand washing is better).
5. **В чем разница между классическим кругом и трапецией?** (Trapezoidal pads are safer for DA machines as they prevent backing plate contact with edges).

## 7. Expert Tips (Thermo System)

-   **ZviZZer Thermo:** These pads do not soften when they get hot. Traditional foam becomes "mushy" after 15 minutes, losing its cutting power. Thermo pads stay stiff and consistent.
-   **Hybrid Wool:** Use it when foam isn't enough, but you want to avoid the mess of traditional long-hair wool.
-   **Vibration reduction:** Sandwich pads (multi-layer) dramatically reduce the fatigue on the operator's hands during long shifts.
