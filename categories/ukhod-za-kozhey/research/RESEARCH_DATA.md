## 1. Intent, Problems & Benefits

**Main Intent:** Preservation of soft, matte, and durable leather upholstery.
**User Problems:**

-   Cracking and peeling (drying out).
-   Dye transfer (from jeans).
-   "Greasy shine" (dirty leather).
-   Spills soaking into perforated areas.
-   Loss of that "new leather" smell.

**Benefits:**

-   Prevents expensive reupholstery.
-   Maintains luxury look and comfort.
-   High interior resale value.
-   Easier cleaning in the future (protective layer).

## 2. Decision Tree (How to Choose)

-   **Age of Leather:** New cars need light protection (balms); Old cars need deep conditioning (creams/star).
-   **Type of Finish:** Matte finish is always the goal.
-   **Problem Type:** Hardness needs Revive; Dirt needs Easy Leather; Maintenance needs Protection Cream.
-   **Application:** For perforations, use foams or thin milks to avoid clogging.

## 3. Product Types

1. **Mild Cleaners:** Ph-neutral, safe for daily use.
2. **Nutrient Creams:** Contain oils and fats to keep leather elastic.
3. **Protection Sealants:** Modern Resins/Ceramics for leather — best for dye transfer protection.

## 4. Maintenance Workflow

1. **Thorough Dusting:** Vacuum seams and perforations.
2. **Deep Cleaning:** Agitate cleaner with a horsehair brush. Wipe with a damp microfiber.
3. **Resting:** Let the leather dry completely.
4. **Conditioning:** Apply cream in thin layers. Let it soak in for 15-30 mins.
5. **Final Wipe:** Remove excess product for a perfect matte finish.

## 5. Common Mistakes

-   Using aggressive APCs (high pH) that strip natural oils.
-   Applying product directly onto the seat (causes spotting).
-   Using silicone-based "gloss" sprays (makes leather slippery and shiny).
-   Neglecting perforated areas (leads to hardening from within).
